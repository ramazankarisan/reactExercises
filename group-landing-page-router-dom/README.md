# Router-band-landing-page

## Tasks

- Create a small React app for a music band.
- Your navigation should contain as many items as the members of your band (4+ members).
- Use the [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/) package to handle your navigation.
- Your solution doesn't have to have any transitions by default.

## What were provided and what I did:

- From the beginning, I did the components and `App.js`. I know it is so simple but in the future I can update it and upgrade it.
