# React useEffect-hook with fetch function exercise

## Tasks:

- For this assignment you need to fetch data from JSONPlaceholder

```js
"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts";
```

- Get all the provided posts
- The data should be assgined to a piece of state when the component is initialized (you need to use useEffect here)

## What were provided:

- Just the Descriptions above were there.

## What I coded:

- Mainly `App.js` was the only file that I should engage myself in so it was. First I fetched the data and get a randomly infos from it. With useEffect hook, I created the button and with onClick handle I can keep doing this.
