# useReducer exercise

- Aim was to work with `useReducer` Hook.
- I created a form and when I submit the form I should be able to see those informations on the screen.
- when I also want to delete them, with the clicking the reagerding button, they could be erasable.
- I also used `contextAPI`.

> I updated the code with `Bootstrap`. Also add `edit` button.
> it is not finished and could not deploy it continuosly, so changes may be made.
