# Inline Styling in React Library

**Task:**

- Replace The styles on hover from CSS with inline style in react.

> Tip: To create the hover effect with react you can use react events : `onMouseEnter` & `onMouseLeave`.

**Note:**

- Using the `style` attribute as the primary is generally not
  recommended. In most cases, `className` should be used
  to reference classes defined in an external CSS stylesheet.
  style is often used in React apps to add dynamically
  computed styles.
