# React Router Dog Finder

## Tasks:

- Build an app that routes to different dogs and displays information on that dog when you're at that route.

## What were provided:

- The engaging and dealing with the routing was the main of this assginment.
- From the start I coded it.

## What I did:

- `App.js` , components `Dogs.js` and `Dog` I coded and used the things about react-router-dom like `useParams`, `useNavigate`, `BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, Link`.
- Added some style and conditional inline styling.
